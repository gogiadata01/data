                <h3>banana</h3>
                <p>
                    Banana plants represent some of the largest herbaceous plants existing in the present, with some reaching up to 9 metres (30 ft) in height.
                     The large herb is composed of a modified underground stem (rhizome), a false trunk, a network of roots, and a large flower spike.
                      The false trunk is an aggregation of the basal portion of leaf sheathes; it is not until the plant is ready to flower that a true stem grows up through the sheath and droops back down towards the ground.

                <h3>Orange</h3>
                <p>
                    The orange fruit is an important agricultural product, used for both the juicy fruit pulp and the aromatic peel (rind).
                     Orange blossoms (the flowers) are used in several different ways, as are the leaves and wood of the tree.

                 <h3>Mango</h3>
                 <p>
                    A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica which is believed to have originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India.
                     M. indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two distinct types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type".
                      Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called "mangoes", the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.
